# City Explorer

**Author**: Joyce Liao and Ryan Milton
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)


## Overview
As a continuation of the API lab from earlier this week, we will be persisting the data in a SQL database. Upon each request, we will check the database for the records that match the search query. If the records exist, we will check how old they are and determine if those records should be used. If the records do not exist, we will request them from the API.


## Getting Started
The user must log onto the website, put in their location request and hit submit button.


## Architecture
We use JavaScript, npm.js, Node.js, Express.js, Superagent, Dotenv and Google's backend server to complete this middle server.
